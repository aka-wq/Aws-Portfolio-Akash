# [AWS Project 1](https://aka-wq.github.io/AWS--Project-1---Akash/)
# Project Description: Implementation and Analysis of Animal Control Data
* This project will include establishing a full-fledged data solution architecture leveraging AWS services to the rate of animals Lost in the year 2024 and include the feature of an Average count of Lost animals apart from the existing architectural support. 
## Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver - Part 1
* The project was to build an enduring apparatus that could efficiently store, clean, transform data, as well as source for the same. It keeps high standards of data security and management in the large datasets, despite maintaining a high level of flexibility, scalability. It also affords real-time analytical results through its enhanced graphical illustration tools.
## Project Objective:
* To calculate the rate of animals lost in the year 2024 using the "Animal Inventory  Lost and Found" dataset from the City of Vancouverâ€™s open data portal. Additionally, a new feature has been incorporated to support and enhance the analysis.
* Designing & Implementing DAP.
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is as follows.
1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Profiling
3. Data Cleaning
4. Data Pipeline Design
5. Exploratory Analysis
6. DAP Cost Estimation
   

## 
Tools and Technologies:
- AWS S3: For secure data storage and versioning.
- AWS KMS: To encrypt and protect data.
- AWS Glue: For building the data pipeline and automating ETL processes.
- Amazon CloudWatch: To monitor system health and set up alarms.
- AWS CloudTrail: For tracking user activities and maintaining compliance.
- AWS Athena: For SQL-based querying of the processed data.


## Deliverables
- A fully configured AWS S3 environment with encryption, versioning, and replication.
- A scalable data pipeline via AWS Glue for processing the animal control data.
- Custom dashboards in Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and visualizing data trends.
- Documentation covering all architectural decisions, security measures, and monitoring strategies.

# [AWS Project 2](https://pkarthik-ops.github.io/AWS-Project-2/)
# Project Description: Data Protection, Governance, and Monitoring
* This project will include establishing a full-fledged data solution architecture leveraging AWS services to the rate of animals Lost in the year 2024 and include the feature of an Average count of Lost animals apart from the existing architectural support.
## Project Title: AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver - Part 2
* This project aims to design and implement a Data Analytics Platform (DAP) using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Data Enriching, Data Protection, Governance, and Monitoring
## Project Objective:
* Designing & Implementing DAP.
## Methodology:
* The process of providing Data Enriching, Data Protection, Governance, and Monitoring for DAP designed as follows.
1. Data Enriching
2. Data Protection
3. Data Governance
4. Data Monitoring
___
## Insights and Findings
- The platform enhances raw animal data by incorporating attributes from internal and external sources, improving its value for analysis in various sectors.
- Lost and found animal information is secured through encryption, replication, and AWS Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring sensitive data remains protected.
- A pipeline using AWS Glue and S3 processes the animal dataset, improving data quality, integrity, and relevance through filtering and transformation.
## Conclusion
* The analysis of the lost and found animal dataset from the City of Vancouver highlights the effectiveness of the AWS Data Analytics Platform in tracking animal recovery efforts. Key findings include a percentage calculation of Lost animals for 2024, revealing trends in lost and found cases. The platform's robust data processing capabilities, including data cleaning and ETL pipeline design, facilitate accurate insights into animal control inventory management.
